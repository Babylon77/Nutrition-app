### **Post-Sprint 2.5 Stability Fixes & Optimizations (June 2025)** üõ†Ô∏è
*A series of critical fixes and improvements were implemented to ensure application stability on Render and resolve data integrity issues that arose during and after Sprint 2.5 deployment.*

- **Render Deployment Stability:**
  - **Session Management**: Implemented `connect-mongo` for persistent MongoDB session storage, resolving `MemoryStore` warnings and ensuring sessions persist across deployments.
  - **Food Queue Robustness**: Addressed a race condition in food queue processing. Initially by adding `req.session.save()`, then by refactoring to a stateless approach where the frontend sends the complete queue to the backend for processing.
  - **Build Error Resolution**: Fixed a TypeScript fallthrough error (`TS7029`) in `backend/src/routes/food.ts` that was causing Render builds to fail.
  - **Rate Limiting Adjustments**: Temporarily increased backend rate limits and frontend debounce times to mitigate "Too many requests" errors on Render. Implemented client-side caching for personal food search as a long-term optimization.

- **Data Integrity & Consistency (Local & Render):**
  - **Date Handling for Food Logs**: Standardized on `YYYY-MM-DD` string format for `FoodLog.date` across storage and querying. This fixed issues with calorie meter discrepancies and food logs not appearing for the correct date due to timezone or `Date` object vs. string mismatches.
  - **Backend `targetDate` Error**: Corrected a TypeScript error in `backend/src/routes/food.ts` where `targetDate` was undefined (after date string refactor), ensuring the backend dev server could start and responses were formatted correctly.
