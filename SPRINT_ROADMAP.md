## Sprint Planning Based on FEATURE_PLANNING.md

This roadmap implements the features and priorities already outlined in `FEATURE_PLANNING.md`, organized into logical development sprints.

---

## **DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES & BEST PRACTICES** üîß

### **Critical Rules for All Sprints**
1. **üö´ Never Break Existing Functionality** - Always test existing features before and after changes
2. **üîó Integration Awareness** - Be cognizant of frontend/backend integration with:
   - OpenAI API (cost implications, rate limits, error handling)
   - MongoDB Database (schema changes, data migrations)
   - Existing API endpoints and data flow
3. **üì± Mobile-First Philosophy** - All new features must be mobile-optimized from day one
   - Test on iPhone 12 and Pixel 7 specifically
   - Responsive design patterns throughout
   - Touch-friendly interactions
4. **‚ö†Ô∏è Compilation Error Monitoring** - Always review terminal for:
   - TypeScript compilation errors
   - ESLint warnings
   - React warnings
   - Build failures

### **Development Workflow**
- **Before**: Test existing functionality
- **During**: Monitor terminal for errors continuously
- **After**: Full mobile testing and integration verification

### **Project Management Notes (From Review)**
- **Sprint Planning**: For future sprints, define clear "Acceptance Criteria" and a "Definition of Done" for each story/task to improve clarity and measurability.
- **Tooling**: Consider exploring GitHub Projects boards for sprint management and `release-please` for automated versioning and changelog generation.

## **SPRINT 2.75: Client-Side Queue Refactor** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
*Priority: CRITICAL | Duration: 0.5 week | Based on Render Stability Issues*

### **Goals**
- ‚úÖ Resolve food queue overwriting issue on Render by making queue management fully client-side.
- ‚úÖ Achieve true statelessness for the queue-building process in the backend.
- ‚úÖ Improve application robustness and predictability in a multi-instance environment.

### **Rationale**
- Persistent issues with `req.session.foodQueue` not reliably persisting between requests on Render when using `connect-mongo`, leading to items being overwritten.
- Adopting a fully client-managed queue for the "Smart Food Entry" feature aligns better with stateless backend principles and is more resilient to cloud platform behaviors (e.g., instance restarts, multiple PIDs).

### **Key Changes**
- **Frontend (`SmartFoodEntry.tsx`)**:
  - ‚úÖ The component will now manage the food queue entirely in its local React state.
  - ‚úÖ Functions `addToQueue`, `removeFromQueue`, `clearQueue` will modify this local state directly, without API calls for these actions.
  - ‚úÖ A unique client-side ID will be generated for each queued item.
  - ‚úÖ The `loadQueue` function (previously fetching from session) will be removed.
  - ‚úÖ The `processQueue` function will send the complete, client-managed queue to the backend.
- **Backend (`/api/food/smart-entry` route)**:
  - ‚úÖ Server-side session management for the food queue (`req.session.foodQueue`) will be removed for the queue-building phase.
  - ‚úÖ API actions `add_to_queue`, `remove_from_queue`, `clear_queue`, `get_queue` will be deprecated/removed as these operations are now client-side.
  - ‚úÖ The `process_queue` action will solely rely on the `itemsToProcess` array sent from the client in the request body.

### **Success Criteria**
- ‚úÖ Users can add multiple food items to the queue in `SmartFoodEntry` on Render without previous items being overwritten.
- ‚úÖ The food queue operates reliably and consistently across both development and production (Render) environments.
- ‚úÖ Backend `smart-entry` endpoint is simplified by removing session-based queue logic.

## **Interim Stability Fixes & Optimizations (Post-Sprint 2.5 / Pre-Sprint 2.75)** üõ†Ô∏è
*Prior to the full client-side queue refactor (Sprint 2.75), several critical fixes and improvements were implemented to enhance application stability on Render and address data integrity issues.*

- **Render Deployment Stability:**
  - **Session Management**: Implemented `connect-mongo` for persistent MongoDB session storage. This resolved `MemoryStore` warnings and was a foundational step towards ensuring sessions could persist across deployments, though queue-specific issues remained until Sprint 2.75.
  - **Food Queue Interim Fixes**: Addressed a race condition in food queue processing by adding explicit `req.session.save()` calls in relevant backend routes. While this provided some improvement, persistent queue overwriting issues on Render necessitated the more comprehensive client-side refactor in Sprint 2.75.
  - **Build Error Resolution**: Fixed a TypeScript fallthrough error (`TS7029`) in `backend/src/routes/food.ts` that was causing Render builds to fail.
  - **Rate Limiting Adjustments**: Temporarily increased backend rate limits and frontend debounce times to mitigate "Too many requests" errors on Render. Implemented client-side caching for personal food search as a long-term optimization.

- **Data Integrity & Consistency (Local & Render):**
  - **Date Handling for Food Logs**: Standardized on `YYYY-MM-DD` string format for `FoodLog.date` across storage and querying. This fixed issues with calorie meter discrepancies and food logs not appearing for the correct date due to timezone or `Date` object vs. string mismatches.
  - **Backend `targetDate` Error**: Corrected a TypeScript error in `backend/src/routes/food.ts` where `targetDate` was undefined (after date string refactor), ensuring the backend dev server could start and responses were formatted correctly.

### **Post-Sprint 3.1 Refinements**
-   ‚úÖ **Calorie and Macronutrient Goal Consistency**: Standardized calorie and macronutrient (protein, carbs, fat) goal calculation logic across the Dashboard and Food Log pages to ensure consistent targets are displayed to the user. This involved aligning activity multipliers, weekly weight change caps (adjusted to 3 lbs/week), and macro derivation logic (protein based on body weight, fat as 25% of target calories, carbs as remainder).
-   [ ] **AI Assistant Chat Persistence**: Ensure AI assistant chat history persists when navigating away from and back to the assistant page.
-   [ ] **Analysis Second Opinion Dropdown**: Fix UI bug preventing selection of the first model (Gemini 1.5 Flash) in the second opinion LLM dropdown on the Analysis page.
-   [ ] **Second Opinion Summary on Main Analysis Card**: Display a concise summary of the second opinion directly on the main analysis card, focusing on key agreements and differences with the primary analysis, rather than just in the detailed view.

## Stubborn Styling Issues (To Be Addressed Later)
*A running list of UI issues that require further investigation or different approaches.*

- [ ] **ARIA Warning on Dialog Close:** Persistent "Blocked `aria-hidden` on a focused element" warning when closing the "Generate New Analysis" dialog in `frontend/src/pages/Analysis.tsx`. This occurs despite various attempts to manage focus restoration.
- [ ] **Chip Outline Cut Off:** The `Chip` component displaying the second opinion model (e.g., "2nd Opinion: Gemini 1.5 Flash") in `frontend/src/pages/Analysis.tsx` has its top border/outline appearing cut off, despite attempts to fix with explicit padding, border, and line-height styles.

## Implementation Based on Existing Strategy

### **Monetization Alignment**
Following the monetization strategy from FEATURE_PLANNING.md:
- **Free Tier**: 100 food lookups/month, 3 AI analyses/month
- **Premium Tier ($9.99)**: Unlimited food logging, personal food database priority
- **Pro Tier ($19.99)**: Multi-LLM analysis, sleep correlation, advanced biomarkers
- **Enterprise ($49.99)**: White-label, API access, bulk management

### **LLM Strategy Implementation**
Following the phased approach from FEATURE_PLANNING.md:
- **Phase 1**: Implement Gemini Pro as second opinion (Sprint 2)
- **Phase 2**: Add Grok API when available
- **Phase 3**: Claude integration for specialized analysis

### **Technical Debt from FEATURE_PLANNING.md**
Ongoing improvements to be integrated into each sprint:
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive throughout
- **Testing**: Automated tests for new features
- **Performance**: Database query optimization
- **Security**: Additional hardening
- **Monitoring**: APM implementation

## Next Steps

1. **Review Sprint 1 scope** against current Smart Food Entry implementation
2. **Validate priorities** with user feedback from the 2 active testers
3. **Confirm technical feasibility** of timeline estimates
4. **Begin Sprint 1 execution** focusing on the identified high-priority limitations

This roadmap now properly builds on your existing comprehensive planning work rather than duplicating it.
