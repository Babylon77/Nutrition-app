## **SPRINT 2.75: Client-Side Queue Refactor** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
*Priority: CRITICAL | Duration: 0.5 week | Based on Render Stability Issues*

### **Goals**
- ‚úÖ Resolve food queue overwriting issue on Render by making queue management fully client-side.
- ‚úÖ Achieve true statelessness for the queue-building process in the backend.
- ‚úÖ Improve application robustness and predictability in a multi-instance environment.

### **Rationale**
- Persistent issues with `req.session.foodQueue` not reliably persisting between requests on Render when using `connect-mongo`, leading to items being overwritten.
- Adopting a fully client-managed queue for the "Smart Food Entry" feature aligns better with stateless backend principles and is more resilient to cloud platform behaviors (e.g., instance restarts, multiple PIDs).

### **Key Changes**
- **Frontend (`SmartFoodEntry.tsx`)**:
  - ‚úÖ The component will now manage the food queue entirely in its local React state.
  - ‚úÖ Functions `addToQueue`, `removeFromQueue`, `clearQueue` will modify this local state directly, without API calls for these actions.
  - ‚úÖ A unique client-side ID will be generated for each queued item.
  - ‚úÖ The `loadQueue` function (previously fetching from session) will be removed.
  - ‚úÖ The `processQueue` function will send the complete, client-managed queue to the backend.
- **Backend (`/api/food/smart-entry` route)**:
  - ‚úÖ Server-side session management for the food queue (`req.session.foodQueue`) will be removed for the queue-building phase.
  - ‚úÖ API actions `add_to_queue`, `remove_from_queue`, `clear_queue`, `get_queue` will be deprecated/removed as these operations are now client-side.
  - ‚úÖ The `process_queue` action will solely rely on the `itemsToProcess` array sent from the client in the request body.

### **Success Criteria**
- ‚úÖ Users can add multiple food items to the queue in `SmartFoodEntry` on Render without previous items being overwritten.
- ‚úÖ The food queue operates reliably and consistently across both development and production (Render) environments.
- ‚úÖ Backend `smart-entry` endpoint is simplified by removing session-based queue logic.

## **Interim Stability Fixes & Optimizations (Post-Sprint 2.5 / Pre-Sprint 2.75)** üõ†Ô∏è
*Prior to the full client-side queue refactor (Sprint 2.75), several critical fixes and improvements were implemented to enhance application stability on Render and address data integrity issues.*

- **Render Deployment Stability:**
  - **Session Management**: Implemented `connect-mongo` for persistent MongoDB session storage. This resolved `MemoryStore` warnings and was a foundational step towards ensuring sessions could persist across deployments, though queue-specific issues remained until Sprint 2.75.
  - **Food Queue Interim Fixes**: Addressed a race condition in food queue processing by adding explicit `req.session.save()` calls in relevant backend routes. While this provided some improvement, persistent queue overwriting issues on Render necessitated the more comprehensive client-side refactor in Sprint 2.75.
  - **Build Error Resolution**: Fixed a TypeScript fallthrough error (`TS7029`) in `backend/src/routes/food.ts` that was causing Render builds to fail.
  - **Rate Limiting Adjustments**: Temporarily increased backend rate limits and frontend debounce times to mitigate "Too many requests" errors on Render. Implemented client-side caching for personal food search as a long-term optimization.

- **Data Integrity & Consistency (Local & Render):**
  - **Date Handling for Food Logs**: Standardized on `YYYY-MM-DD` string format for `FoodLog.date` across storage and querying. This fixed issues with calorie meter discrepancies and food logs not appearing for the correct date due to timezone or `Date` object vs. string mismatches.
  - **Backend `targetDate` Error**: Corrected a TypeScript error in `backend/src/routes/food.ts` where `targetDate` was undefined (after date string refactor), ensuring the backend dev server could start and responses were formatted correctly.

    -   ‚úÖ Task: Implement the backend logic required to request a new analysis from the selected alternative LLM using the same input data as the original analysis, including a comparative analysis step. (COMPLETED)
    -   ‚úÖ Task: Design and implement a clear UI to present the second opinion, including displaying it in the analysis details view. (COMPLETED)

### **Success Criteria**
-   ‚úÖ AI Assistant interactions are more readable and user-friendly. (COMPLETED)

### **Post-Sprint 3.1 Refinements**
-   ‚úÖ **Calorie and Macronutrient Goal Consistency**: Standardized calorie and macronutrient (protein, carbs, fat) goal calculation logic across the Dashboard and Food Log pages to ensure consistent targets are displayed to the user. This involved aligning activity multipliers, weekly weight change caps (adjusted to 3 lbs/week), and macro derivation logic (protein based on body weight, fat as 25% of target calories, carbs as remainder).
