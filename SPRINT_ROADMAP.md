## **DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES & BEST PRACTICES** üîß

### **Critical Rules for All Sprints**
1. **üö´ Never Break Existing Functionality** - Always test existing features before and after changes
2. **üîó Integration Awareness** - Be cognizant of frontend/backend integration with:
   - OpenAI API (cost implications, rate limits, error handling)
   - MongoDB Database (schema changes, data migrations)
   - Existing API endpoints and data flow
3. **üì± Mobile-First Philosophy** - All new features must be mobile-optimized from day one
   - Test on iPhone 12 and Pixel 7 specifically
   - Responsive design patterns throughout
   - Touch-friendly interactions
4. **‚ö†Ô∏è Compilation Error Monitoring** - Always review terminal for:
   - TypeScript compilation errors
   - ESLint warnings
   - React warnings
   - Build failures

### **Development Workflow**
- **Before**: Test existing functionality
