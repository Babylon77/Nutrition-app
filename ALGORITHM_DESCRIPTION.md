# Fuel IQ Algorithm Description Document (ADD)

## System Purpose

Fuel IQ transforms nutrition tracking from manual data entry into an intelligent coaching system. The platform analyzes natural language food descriptions using artificial intelligence, automatically calculates comprehensive nutrition profiles, and provides personalized insights based on individual patterns and goals.

The core innovation lies in removing the traditional barriers to nutrition tracking: users simply describe what they ate in everyday language, and the system handles all the complex nutrition analysis, portion calculations, and trend identification behind the scenes.

## High-Level Architecture

Fuel IQ operates as a three-tier intelligent nutrition platform where each layer serves a specific purpose in the data transformation pipeline.

**User Interface Layer**: The frontend presents a mobile-first progressive web application that prioritizes speed and simplicity. Users interact primarily through natural language input rather than traditional form-based data entry. The interface adapts intelligently to screen sizes, with mobile users seeing streamlined views focused on quick logging, while desktop users access expanded analytics and detailed nutrition breakdowns.

**Intelligence Processing Layer**: The backend serves as the brain of the system, coordinating between user inputs, artificial intelligence analysis, data storage, and insight generation. This layer handles the complex orchestration of converting free-form text into structured nutrition data, managing user preferences and goals, calculating daily and weekly trends, and generating personalized recommendations.
    - **Planned Architectural Enhancements**: To improve testability, maintainability, and scalability, the backend is planned for refactoring. This includes separating concerns more clearly by introducing a dedicated services layer for business logic, distinct from controllers (handling HTTP requests/responses) and models (data access). Robust input validation (e.g., using Zod or Joi) will be implemented at the API boundary. A centralized error handling mechanism will be established for more consistent and informative error responses. For performance and cost-efficiency with external AI APIs, asynchronous processing via a job queue (e.g., BullMQ) is planned for operations like food analysis, with client-side updates potentially handled via polling or WebSockets. Enhanced rate limiting and caching strategies for these external calls are also planned.

**Data Persistence Layer**: MongoDB stores the complex, interconnected nutrition data in a flexible document structure that accommodates the variability of food descriptions, personal eating patterns, and evolving user preferences. The database design optimizes for both quick daily logging operations and complex analytical queries across historical data.
    - **Planned Enhancements**: A review and implementation of necessary database indexes (e.g., compound indexes on frequently queried fields like `userId` and `date` in food logs) are planned to ensure optimal query performance as data volume grows.

## AI & External Services

### Natural Language Food Analysis

The heart of Fuel IQ's intelligence lies in its ability to understand how people naturally describe food. When a user inputs something like "two slices of whole wheat toast with avocado and a drizzle of olive oil," the system employs a sophisticated analysis process.

**Context-Aware Processing**: The AI doesn't just analyze food in isolation. It considers the meal context (breakfast foods are interpreted differently than dinner foods), user dietary preferences (a vegetarian's "burger" likely refers to a plant-based option), and historical patterns (if someone consistently logs steel-cut oats, "oats" probably refers to that preparation method).

**Confidence Scoring Algorithm**: Every AI analysis includes a confidence score that reflects how certain the system is about its nutritional calculations. Common whole foods receive high confidence scores (0.9+), prepared restaurant dishes receive medium scores (0.7-0.8), and ambiguous descriptions receive lower scores (0.5-0.6). This scoring drives the user experience - high-confidence analyses appear immediately, while low-confidence results prompt users for clarification.

**Progressive Learning**: The system builds a personal food database for each user, learning their language patterns, preferred brands, and typical portion sizes. When someone consistently logs "my usual breakfast," the system recognizes this pattern and can automatically suggest the appropriate foods based on historical data.

**Multi-LLM Second Opinion Capability**: For nutrition and health analyses, Fuel IQ now incorporates a multi-LLM approach. Users can request a "second opinion" on an existing analysis from an alternative Large Language Model (e.g., Google's Gemini series, in addition to OpenAI models). The system retrieves the original input data for the analysis and sends it to the selected secondary LLM. It then performs a comparative analysis, presenting both the independent findings of the second LLM and a report highlighting similarities and differences from the primary analysis. This enhances the robustness and reliability of insights by offering diverse AI perspectives.

### Supplement Intelligence Integration

Supplement tracking presents unique challenges because users describe supplements inconsistently and dosage timing is critical for adherence tracking.

**Smart Dosage Recognition**: When users input supplement information, the AI parses complex descriptions like "500mg magnesium glycinate before bed" to extract the supplement name, dosage amount, specific form, and timing preferences. The system handles various unit conversions and recognizes when users mention brand names versus generic ingredients.

**Schedule Generation Logic**: Based on frequency patterns (daily, twice daily, weekly), the system automatically generates personalized schedules. For twice-daily supplements, it intelligently suggests morning and evening timing unless the user specifies otherwise. For supplements that require specific timing (like probiotics with meals), the system incorporates these requirements into the schedule.

**Adherence Pattern Analysis**: The system tracks when supplements are marked as taken versus scheduled times, identifying patterns of missed doses and suggesting schedule adjustments. If someone consistently misses evening supplements, the system might suggest switching to morning-only timing.

## Frontend Logic

### User Experience Flow Design

The frontend orchestrates a carefully designed flow that minimizes cognitive load while maximizing data capture accuracy.

**Smart Entry Process**: The food logging experience begins with a single text input where users describe their meal in natural language. As they type, the system provides intelligent autocomplete suggestions based on their personal food history and common foods. The analysis happens in real-time, with results appearing within 2-3 seconds of input completion.

**Progressive Disclosure Interface**: Rather than overwhelming users with detailed nutrition data immediately, the interface reveals information progressively. Initial views show calories and major macronutrients, with micronutrients available through expandable sections. Power users can access detailed nutrition breakdowns, while casual users see simplified summaries.

**Contextual Assistance**: The system learns user patterns and provides contextual help. If someone typically logs breakfast around 8 AM but opens the app at 2 PM, the system intelligently defaults to lunch logging. If a user frequently forgets to log snacks, gentle reminders appear during typical snacking hours.

### Responsive Design Strategy

The interface adapts not just to screen sizes but to usage patterns across devices.

**Mobile-First Optimization**: Mobile interfaces prioritize speed and thumb-friendly interactions. Large tap targets, swipe gestures for common actions, and simplified navigation paths reduce friction for the most common use case: quick meal logging on mobile devices.

**Desktop Enhancement**: Desktop users access expanded features like detailed nutrition charts, bulk food entry capabilities, and advanced analytics dashboards. The same core functionality remains consistent, but additional tools become available for users who want deeper analysis capabilities.

**Offline-First Architecture**: The application functions fully offline for core features, with data syncing automatically when connectivity returns. This ensures users can log meals even in poor network conditions, with the system resolving any conflicts intelligently during synchronization.

## Backend Logic

### Authentication & User Management

The backend implements a comprehensive user management system that balances security with user convenience.

**Token-Based Security**: User sessions utilize JSON Web Tokens with automatic refresh capabilities, allowing extended usage without repeated login prompts while maintaining security through token rotation. The system includes rate limiting to prevent abuse and automatic session cleanup for inactive accounts.

**Preference Learning Engine**: As users interact with the system, their preferences are continuously learned and refined. Dietary restrictions influence AI food analysis, typical meal timing affects reminder schedules, and portion preferences inform quantity suggestions for familiar foods.

### Data Processing Pipeline

The backend orchestrates complex data flows that transform raw user inputs into meaningful insights.

**Real-Time Analysis Pipeline (Future State with Job Queue)**: When users submit food descriptions, the system will first check their personal food database. If no match, the request will be added to a job queue for asynchronous processing by the AI service (with user context). The client will receive an immediate acknowledgment (e.g., HTTP 202) and can then poll for results or receive updates via WebSockets. This improves UI responsiveness and system throughput.
    - **Current State**: AI analysis is largely synchronous. The transition to asynchronous processing is a planned architectural improvement.

**Nutrition Calculation Engine**: The system converts AI-analyzed foods into precise nutrition data by handling unit conversions, portion scaling, and micronutrient calculations. It validates results against known ranges and flags unusual values for review, ensuring data quality remains high. The calculation of daily calorie and macronutrient goals (protein, carbohydrates, fat) has been standardized across different application sections (e.g., Dashboard, Food Log) to ensure consistency. This involves using consistent activity multipliers, safe weight change caps, and defined logic for macro derivation (e.g., protein based on body weight, fat as a percentage of target calories, carbohydrates as the remainder).

**Aggregation and Trend Analysis**: Background processes continuously calculate daily nutrition totals, weekly trends, and goal achievement metrics. These calculations update in real-time as users log foods, providing immediate feedback on nutrition status throughout the day.

### AI Assistant Subsystem

Fuel IQ includes an AI Assistant designed to provide conversational support, insights, and actions. The assistant's capabilities are integrated throughout the application.

**Conversational Food Logging**: Users can interact with the AI Assistant to log food items using natural language commands (e.g., "Log 2 eggs and a slice of toast for breakfast"). The assistant parses these commands, confirms details if necessary, and then directly adds the food items to the user's daily log, leveraging the same AI food analysis pipeline used for manual entries.

**Expanded Data Context & App Knowledge**: The AI Assistant now has comprehensive access to the user's data, including food logs, personal food items, supplement logs, and bloodwork results. Furthermore, its knowledge base includes information about the app's functionality, features, and usage guidelines (derived from `README.md`, `ALGORITHM_DESCRIPTION.md`, and `TUTORIAL_CONTENT.md`). This expanded context allows the assistant to provide more personalized, accurate, and helpful responses, understand user queries better, and guide users on how to use the app effectively.

**Improved Readability and UX**: The AI Assistant's output has been redesigned for better readability and user experience on both mobile and desktop platforms, incorporating clearer typography and spacing.

### Background Task Management

The system runs numerous background processes that enhance user experience without requiring direct interaction.

**Supplement Reminder System**: Based on user-defined supplement regimens, the system generates daily schedules and sends timely reminders. The reminder timing adapts to user behavior - if someone consistently takes morning supplements at 7 AM, reminders arrive slightly earlier to establish routine.

**Data Quality Monitoring**: Background processes monitor the accuracy of AI analyses by tracking user corrections and confidence scores. When patterns emerge indicating systematic issues with certain food types, the system automatically adjusts prompts and validation rules.

**Insight Generation**: The system analyzes historical data to identify patterns and generate personalized insights. These might include observations about nutrition gaps, successful goal achievement patterns, or suggestions for dietary improvements based on individual data.

## Database & Data Flows

### User-Centric Data Architecture

The database design centers around individual user experiences while enabling system-wide learning and optimization.

**Personal Food Libraries**: Each user builds a personalized database of frequently consumed foods, capturing their specific language patterns, preferred brands, and typical portions. This personal library improves analysis speed and accuracy over time, creating a truly customized experience.

**Hierarchical Nutrition Storage**: Food data is stored with hierarchical nutrition information - base nutrition per 100 grams for standardization, actual nutrition for consumed quantities, and aggregated totals for meals and days. This structure enables flexible querying for different analytical purposes.

**Time-Series Optimization**: All nutrition data includes temporal components optimized for trend analysis. The system can efficiently calculate rolling averages, identify patterns across weeks or months, and detect significant changes in eating patterns or nutrition intake.

### Data Flow Patterns

The system handles different data access patterns with specialized optimization strategies.

**Write-Heavy Operations**: Food logging and supplement tracking are optimized for quick writes, with minimal validation during entry and more comprehensive processing happening asynchronously. This ensures the user interface remains responsive during peak logging times.

**Read-Heavy Analytics**: Dashboard queries and nutrition summaries use pre-calculated aggregations and caching strategies to deliver instant results. The system maintains running totals and trend calculations to avoid expensive recalculations on every request.

**Cross-User Learning**: While maintaining strict user privacy, the system learns from collective patterns to improve AI analysis for everyone. Common food descriptions and their associated nutrition data inform better parsing of similar requests from other users.

## Security & Privacy

### Data Protection Philosophy

Fuel IQ implements a privacy-by-design approach where user control and data minimization guide all technical decisions.

**Layered Data Encryption**: All nutrition and health data remains encrypted both in transit and at rest, with personal identifiers stored separately from health information. This separation ensures that even in the unlikely event of a data breach, nutrition patterns cannot be linked to specific individuals without additional access.

**AI Privacy Protection**: Food descriptions sent to external AI services are completely anonymized, containing no user identifiers or account information. The system maintains local caches of AI responses to minimize external API calls while preserving user privacy.

**User Control Mechanisms**: Users maintain complete control over their data with granular privacy settings, including the ability to opt out of AI features entirely while retaining full manual tracking capabilities.
