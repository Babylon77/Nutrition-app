- **Users**: 2 active testers
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas (production)
- **Status**: Fully functional MVP

## Current MVP Limitations üìù

### Food System Limitations
- [ ] **Bulk Food Entry**: One item at a time (should allow multiple foods before API call)
- [ ] **Personal Food Database**: No user-specific food history/favorites (should search personal DB first)
- [ ] **User Food Adjustments**: Can't adjust AI estimates (e.g., change 5oz to 8oz with proportional macro scaling)
- [ ] **API Optimization**: Each food = separate API call (costly and slow)
- [ ] **Advanced Input Modes**: No photo + voice/text description for complex dishes
- [ ] **Supplements Tracking**: No separate section for daily supplements, vitamins, medications

### Health Analytics Limitations
- [ ] **Single LLM Analysis**: No second opinion or cross-model validation
- [ ] **Limited Biomarkers**: Missing key hormones (Testosterone, etc.)
- [ ] **Manual PDF Processing**: No LLM-powered extraction from bloodwork PDFs
- [ ] **Basic Health Metrics UI**: Manual entry not intuitive enough
- [ ] **No Sleep Integration**: Missing critical sleep data correlation
- [ ] **No Lifestyle Tracking**: No alcohol, smoking, or other lifestyle factor tracking
- [ ] **No Health Metrics History**: No historical tracking and trend analysis
- [ ] **No Educational Context**: No links to research, debates, expert perspectives

### UX/UI Limitations

### Technical Limitations
- [ ] **API Dependency**: Relies on OpenAI API (cost/rate limits/availability)
- [ ] **Offline Capability**: None (requires internet connection)
- [ ] **Data Export**: No export functionality for user data
- [ ] **Barcode Scanning**: No UPC/barcode lookup for packaged foods

### Feature Gaps
- [ ] **Social Features**: No sharing, friends, or community aspects
- [ ] **Integrations**: No fitness tracker, smart scale, or other app connections
- [ ] **Advanced Analytics**: Basic AI analysis (could be more sophisticated)
