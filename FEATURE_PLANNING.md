## Recent Debugging & Fixes (Post-Sprint 2.5) üõ†Ô∏è

### v1.0.4 - Render Stability & Data Integrity (06/01/2025)
- ‚úÖ **Fixed: Production Session Store**: Resolved `connect.session() MemoryStore` warning by integrating `connect-mongo` for persistent MongoDB session storage on Render. This was a foundational step for session reliability.
- ‚úÖ **Fixed: Food Queue Processing on Render (Evolution)**:
    - ‚úÖ Initial attempts to stabilize the session-based food queue on Render included adding explicit `req.session.save()` calls after queue modifications in the backend.
    - ‚úÖ While this provided some improvement, persistent issues with queue items being overwritten on Render led to a more comprehensive solution: a full refactor to client-side queue management. This involved making the backend stateless for queue building and having the frontend send the complete queue for processing (detailed as Sprint 2.75 in `SPRINT_ROADMAP.md`). This ultimately resolved the queue stability problems.
- ‚úÖ **Fixed: Render Build Fallthrough Error**: Corrected TypeScript error `TS7029: Fallthrough case in switch` in `backend/src/routes/food.ts` by adding a `break;` statement.
- ‚úÖ **Addressed: API Rate Limiting on Render**:
    - Temporarily increased backend rate limits and frontend debounce time for `SmartFoodEntry` search.
    - Implemented client-side caching for personal food search results in `SmartFoodEntry.tsx` as a long-term optimization to reduce API calls.
- **Fixed: Calorie Meter & Food Log Date Discrepancies (Local & Render)**: Ensured consistent `YYYY-MM-DD` string handling for `FoodLog.date` in backend queries (`/api/food/summary`, `/api/food/logs/:date`) and storage, resolving issues where "today's" foods weren't correctly reflected due to timezone/date object mismatches.
- **Fixed: Food Logs Not Appearing (DB Date Type Mismatch)**: Corrected backend `POST` and `PUT` routes for `/api/food/logs/:date` to save dates as `YYYY-MM-DD` strings, matching query logic and fixing data retrieval.
- **Fixed: Local Backend Startup Error (`targetDate` not found)**: Resolved TypeScript error in `backend/src/routes/food.ts` by correcting `targetDate` references used for response formatting to use `new Date(dateString)`, ensuring dev server stability.

### v1.0.3 - Timezone Bug Fix (5/29/2025)
- **Fixed**: Date storage timezone issue where food logged in user's local time was appearing on wrong date
- **Technical**: Changed from UTC Date objects to local date strings in both frontend and backend
- **Impact**: Food logs now correctly appear on the date they were entered in user's local timezone

### v1.0.2 - Production Deployment
- **Fixed**: API URL configuration for production vs development
- **Fixed**: MongoDB Atlas network access and connection
- **Added**: Auto-deploy on git push to master branch

### Further UI/UX Improvement Ideas (Brainstormed)
*   **Dashboard Customization:** Allow users to personalize the main dashboard by choosing which widgets are visible and their order.
*   **Enhanced Food Search with Quick Add Filters:** Improve food search with more robust autocomplete (showing key nutrition facts in results) and filters for "recently logged," "personal foods," etc.
*   **Interactive Goal Setting & Adjustment:** Make setting nutrition/weight goals more visual and interactive (e.g., sliders, visual feedback on impacts).
*   **Streamlined "Quick Log" for Common Items/Meals:** Offer a feature for one-click logging of frequently eaten foods or saved meals.
*   **Contextual Micro-Interactions & Feedback:** Add subtle animations or micro-interactions for better visual feedback and a more polished feel.

## Go-To-Market & Positioning Notes

- **Target Niche**: Focus initial efforts on the quantified-self / bio-hacker community (e.g., relevant subreddits) who are often early adopters and value detailed tracking but may find current food logging cumbersome.
- **Pricing USP**: Emphasize a "Free-forever logging; pay only for pro analytics" model. Highlight that core food logging, personal DB, and basic supplement tracking are free, with premium charges for advanced AI analysis, multi-LLM, detailed correlations, etc.
- **Key Differentiators to Highlight**: AI macro-breakdown for custom foods, supplement tracking, PDF-bloodwork parsing (when fully implemented), multi-LLM second opinions.

## Security & Compliance Considerations

- Key security and compliance measures, including password storage, PII encryption, consent flows, and data deletion rights, are tracked in `SECURITY_AND_COMPLIANCE.md`.
- [ ] Implement granular user consent flows, especially for sensitive data (bloodwork, AI-analyzed journal entries).
- [ ] Develop a robust data deletion endpoint and process per user request.
