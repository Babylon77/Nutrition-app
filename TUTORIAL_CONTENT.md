This document provides the AI Assistant with information about Fuel IQ's features and how to use them, based on the in-app tutorials.

## General Introduction & Core Concepts

### Welcome to your nutrition journey! ðŸŽ‰
Fuel IQ is an intelligent nutrition tracking app. Let's take 60 seconds to show you how to get the most from this app.
Tip: You can replay tutorials anytime by clicking the help icon (Note: Help icon functionality might be under review).

### Smart Food Entry
This is your main tool for logging meals. It's designed to be intelligent and efficient:
- It searches your **personal foods** first (items you've logged before, which are processed instantly).
- For new items, it uses AI analysis.
- **Pro tip for Smart Food Entry:** Add multiple foods to the queue before analyzing to save on AI processing costs and time by batching requests.

### Nutrition Analytics
The app allows you to see detailed breakdowns of over 30 nutrients from your food logs. You can also get AI-powered health insights and track your progress over time.

### Bloodwork Integration
You can upload your lab results (e.g., from PDF or manual entry) to see how your diet affects your health markers. The AI can provide personalized recommendations based on this integrated data.

## Detailed Feature Tutorials

### Using the Smart Food Entry Page

#### Searching for Foods
- Start typing any food in the search input.
- The system first checks your **Personal Foods** (displayed in green). These are foods you've logged before; selecting them is instant and doesn't require new AI analysis.
- If it's a new food, the app will suggest items that need AI analysis.

#### Food Queue System
- Before processing, you can add multiple foods (both personal and new) to a queue.
- This is highly recommended as it batches AI requests for new foods, saving processing time and potential costs.

### Understanding the Analytics Page

#### Daily Nutrition Summary
- This section tracks over 30 nutrients, including vitamins, minerals, and macronutrients, based on your daily food logs.
- Color indicators (e.g., red, green) can help you quickly identify potential deficiencies or areas where you're on track with your nutritional goals.

#### AI Health Analysis (General)
- You can request AI-powered analyses that provide personalized recommendations.
- These analyses consider your nutrition data from food logs, your stated health goals, and bloodwork results if you've uploaded them.

### Managing Bloodwork Data

#### Uploading Lab Results
- You can upload PDF files of your lab results or manually enter biomarker data.
- The AI can then correlate this bloodwork data with your nutrition logs to provide more comprehensive and personalized insights.

## AI Assistant Capabilities

### Conversational Food Logging
- You can log food directly through chat. For example:
    - "log an apple for breakfast"
    - "I had chicken and rice for dinner"
    - "add yogurt to my snack today"
- The assistant will try to extract the food description, meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack - defaults to snack if unspecified), and date (today, yesterday - defaults to today if unspecified).

### Answering Questions
- The AI Assistant can answer questions about:
    - Your nutrition (based on the data you've logged).
    - Your health data (if provided).
    - How to use the Fuel IQ app (based on this tutorial information and other app documentation).
- If unsure, the assistant should state that rather than guessing.
